# PRP Base
Perfect — this is an excellent, structured base for a Gemini-style PRP (Product Requirements Prompt). I’ve formatted it cleanly as a reusable Markdown template file named prp_base.md. This will be read by generate-prp.sh and filled dynamically (e.g., replacing placeholders with actual values from INITIAL.md, GEMINI.md, etc.).

✅ prp_base.md (Template for generate-prp.sh)

#  Product Requirements Prompt (PRP)

---

## 1. Overview

- **Feature Name:** _A short, descriptive name for the feature._

- **Objective:** _One sentence summary of the goal. What are we building?_

- **Why:** _What user problem does this solve or what value does it create?_

---

## 2. Success Criteria

_This feature will be considered complete when the following conditions are met:_

- [ ] The code runs without errors.

- [ ] All new unit tests pass (or manual test steps succeed).

- [ ] The feature meets all functional requirements described below.

- [ ] The code adheres to the project standards defined in `GEMINI.md`.

---

## 3. Context & Resources

###  External Documentation

_List any URLs for libraries, APIs, or tutorials._

- **Resource:** [https://example.com]  
  - **Purpose:** _Explain which parts are relevant._

---

###  Internal Codebase Patterns

_List any files in `examples/` or existing project files that show a pattern to follow._

- **File:** `examples/sample.js`  
  - **Reason:** _Use the animation + state logic from this component._

---

### ⚠️ Known Pitfalls

_List critical warnings, rate limits, or tricky logic to be aware of._

- _e.g., "Firebase rules block write access if user is not authenticated."_  
- _e.g., "Animation libraries must work on mobile — avoid GSAP."_

---

## 4. Implementation Blueprint

###  Proposed File Structure

_Show the desired directory tree. Include new or modified files._

src/ └── new_feature/ ├── index.jsx         (new) └── logic.js          (new)

examples/ └── reward_example.js     (reference)

---

### ✅ Task Breakdown

**Task 1: UI Component**

- Create a new responsive component using Tailwind and Framer Motion.

**Task 2: Core Logic**

- Handle user input, Firebase write, and animation feedback.

```js
// Pseudocode:
function handleSubmit(task) {
  if (!task) throw new Error("Missing task")
  addTaskToFirebase(task)
  animateTask()
}

Task 3: Manual Test Setup

Link component into /App.jsx or main view and test reward logic.



---

5. Validation Plan

 Unit Tests / Manual Validation

List what to test to verify correctness.

test_valid_input() – Confirm success on normal use case.

test_empty_input() – Show graceful error if input is blank.

test_db_failure() – Catch and log Firebase failures.



---

‍ Manual Test Command

Provide a simple command or interaction to verify visually or through the console.

# Run app
npm run dev

Expected Output (Console or UI):

✅ Task added!
 10 coins rewarded!

# GEMINI.md Context
#  The Developer's Pact
This document outlines the core principles and conventions we will follow in this project. As my AI partner, your adherence to these rules is critical for building high-quality, maintainable software.

---

## ️ Principle 1: Architecture & Project Structure

- **500-Line Rule:** No single file should exceed 500 lines. If it grows too large, propose a clear refactoring plan to break it into smaller files or modules.

- **Feature-Based Grouping:** Group files by feature or component, not by file type. For example:

/src/components/TodoList.jsx /src/components/TodoItem.jsx /src/features/auth/firebaseConfig.js

- **Modular by Default:** Reuse logic via utility functions (`/src/utils/`) and shared UI components.

- **Simple Examples Folder:** Use `/examples/` to store working reference code that Gemini can learn from. Keep them clean and focused on one concept per file.

---

## ✅ Principle 2: Code Quality & Maintainability

- **Readable Over Clever:** Prioritize readability. Avoid complex one-liners if they reduce clarity.

- **Manual Testing:** Since you’re developing on mobile (Termux), you’ll manually test features in-browser. If something should be tested, explain how to test it in the PRP response.

- **Inline Documentation:**
- Use `// WHY:` or `/* WHY: */` comments for non-obvious logic.
- Keep logic grouped in sections with clear comment headers if needed.

- **Naming Consistency:**
- Functions: `camelCase`
- Components: `PascalCase`
- Files: match component/function names

---

## ✍️ Principle 3: Styling & UI

- **Tailwind First:** Use Tailwind CSS for all styling. Group classes logically:
```html
<div class="flex flex-col gap-2 p-4 bg-white shadow-md rounded-xl">

Responsiveness Required: All layouts must be responsive to fit both mobile and desktop.

Animation and Motion: Use libraries compatible with mobile builds (e.g., Framer Motion, Tailwind plugins). Keep transitions smooth and purposeful.

Dark Mode Optional: Use system-level dark: variants in Tailwind where possible.



---

 Principle 4: Environment & Security

No Hardcoded Secrets: Never include real API keys or secrets in code. Use .env and .env.example.

Firebase/Auth Configs: Store Firebase setup files in /src/config/firebase.js or similar — keep it isolated from core logic.

Safe Defaults: Always provide fallback values (e.g., process.env.API_URL || 'http://localhost:3000').



---

 Principle 5: Behavior as AI Assistant

No Hallucination: Do not invent library names, file paths, or tool chains. If unsure, ask the user for clarity.

Explain Before Code: For medium or large tasks, provide a bullet-plan or pseudocode first. Don’t write code until the plan is approved.

Context-Aware Suggestions: Suggestions should match:

Mobile-first UI development (Tailwind + React)

Termux limitations (no Docker, no VS Code extensions)

Git + CLI workflows


Be Explicit About Output: If the output includes multiple files or updates, list them clearly first, then show the content

# INITIAL.md Context
# ️ Feature Request – Aesthetic Weather App

---

##  The Goal

Build a minimalist, aesthetic weather app using a free weather API (like OpenWeatherMap).  
Users should be able to:

- Enter a city name  
- View current weather (temperature, condition, emoji/icon)  
- Enjoy smooth UI transitions, pastel backgrounds, and responsive layout  
- View errors and logs using **Eruda** debug console (mobile-compatible)

️ **All source code must be placed inside the `/src` folder.**  
 **Deployment to Vercel will be handled manually — do not configure deployment logic.**

---

##  Inspiration & Examples

- **File:** `examples/components/WeatherCard.jsx`  
  **Reason:** Shows component structure using Tailwind + conditionally styled content

- **File:** `examples/api/fetchWeather.js`  
  **Reason:** Demonstrates async fetch + fallback UI logic

---

##  Required Knowledge

- [OpenWeatherMap API Docs](https://openweathermap.org/current)  
  Use: `https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=London&appid=YOUR_API_KEY`

- [TailwindCSS v3.4.1](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation)  
  Stick to v3.4.1 (Termux-friendly)

- [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/)  
  Light use for transitions and motion effects

- [Eruda Debug Console](https://github.com/liriliri/eruda)  
  A mobile-compatible browser console — must be included in development mode

---

## ⚠️ Potential Pitfalls & Gotchas

- ❗ Free APIs like OpenWeatherMap have **rate limits** — throttle requests  
- ❗ Always use **Eruda** for logs — no native browser console on Termux  
- ❗ Tailwind v4 is incompatible — use 3.4.1 only  
- ❗ Don't hardcode the API key — use `.env` or local fallback  
- ❗ Keep all UI components and logic under `/src/`  
- ❗ Weather icons may be low-res — use emojis or SVGs for a better look  
- ❗ Background gradients should be performance-friendly for mobile devices  

---

##  Notes from Dev Standards

- Design must be minimalist and responsive (mobile + desktop)  
- Pastel theme (e.g., purple, pink, blue gradients)  
- Use emojis/icons over large image assets  
- Tailwind utility classes only — no external CSS files  
- Use GitHub for versioning  
- Vercel deploy must be done manually (`vite build`, output: `/dist`)
