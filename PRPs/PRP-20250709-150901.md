# PRP Base
Perfect — this is an excellent, structured base for a Gemini-style PRP (Product Requirements Prompt). I’ve formatted it cleanly as a reusable Markdown template file named prp_base.md. This will be read by generate-prp.sh and filled dynamically (e.g., replacing placeholders with actual values from INITIAL.md, GEMINI.md, etc.).

## 1. Overview

- **Feature Name:** _A short, descriptive name for the feature._

- **Objective:** _One sentence summary of the goal. What are we building?_

- **Why:** _What user problem does this solve or what value does it create?_

---

## 2. Success Criteria

_This feature will be considered complete when the following conditions are met:_

- [ ] The code runs without errors.

- [ ] All new unit tests pass (or manual test steps succeed).

- [ ] The feature meets all functional requirements described below.

## 3. Context & Resources

###  External Documentation

_List any URLs for libraries, APIs, or tutorials._

- **Resource:** [https://example.com]  
  - **Purpose:** _Explain which parts are relevant._

---

###  Internal Codebase Patterns

_List any files in `examples/` or existing project files that show a pattern to follow._

- **File:** `examples/sample.js`  
  - **Reason:** _Use the animation + state logic from this component._

---

### ⚠️ Known Pitfalls

_List critical warnings, rate limits, or tricky logic to be aware of._

- _e.g., "Firebase rules block write access if user is not authenticated."_  
- _e.g., "Animation libraries must work on mobile — avoid GSAP."_

## 4. Implementation Blueprint

###  Proposed File Structure

_Show the desired directory tree. Include new or modified files._

src/ └── new_feature/ ├── index.jsx         (new) └── logic.js          (new)

examples/ └── reward_example.js     (reference)

---

### ✅ Task Breakdown

**Task 1: UI Component**

- Create a new responsive component using Tailwind and Framer Motion.

**Task 2: Core Logic**

- Handle user input, Firebase write, and animation feedback.

```js
// Pseudocode:
function handleSubmit(task) {
  if (!task) throw new Error("Missing task")
  addTaskToFirebase(task)
  animateTask()
}

Task 3: Manual Test Setup

Link component into /App.jsx or main view and test reward logic.



---

5. Validation Plan

 Unit Tests / Manual Validation

List what to test to verify correctness.

test_valid_input() – Confirm success on normal use case.

test_empty_input() – Show graceful error if input is blank.

test_db_failure() – Catch and log Firebase failures.



---

‍ Manual Test Command

Provide a simple command or interaction to verify visually or through the console.

# Run app
npm run dev

Expected Output (Console or UI):

✅ Task added!
 10 coins rewarded!

# GEMINI.md Context
#  The Developer's Pact
This document outlines the core principles and conventions we will follow in this project. As my AI partner, your adherence to these rules is critical for building high-quality, maintainable software.

---

## ️ Principle 1: Architecture & Project Structure

- **500-Line Rule:** No single file should exceed 500 lines. If it grows too large, propose a clear refactoring plan to break it into smaller files or modules.

- **Feature-Based Grouping:** Group files by feature or component, not by file type. For example:

/src/components/TodoList.jsx /src/components/TodoItem.jsx /src/features/auth/firebaseConfig.js

- **Modular by Default:** Reuse logic via utility functions (`/src/utils/`) and shared UI components.

- **Simple Examples Folder:** Use `/examples/` to store working reference code that Gemini can learn from. Keep them clean and focused on one concept per file.

---

## ✅ Principle 2: Code Quality & Maintainability

- **Readable Over Clever:** Prioritize readability. Avoid complex one-liners if they reduce clarity.

- **Manual Testing:** Since you’re developing on mobile (Termux), you’ll manually test features in-browser. If something should be tested, explain how to test it in the PRP response.

- **Inline Documentation:**
- Use `// WHY:` or `/* WHY: */` comments for non-obvious logic.
- Keep logic grouped in sections with clear comment headers if needed.

- **Naming Consistency:**
- Functions: `camelCase`
- Components: `PascalCase`
- Files: match component/function names

---

## ✍️ Principle 3: Styling & UI

- **Tailwind First:** Use Tailwind CSS for all styling. Group classes logically:
```html
<div class="flex flex-col gap-2 p-4 bg-white shadow-md rounded-xl">

Responsiveness Required: All layouts must be responsive to fit both mobile and desktop.

Animation and Motion: Use libraries compatible with mobile builds (e.g., Framer Motion, Tailwind plugins). Keep transitions smooth and purposeful.

Dark Mode Optional: Use system-level dark: variants in Tailwind where possible.



---

 Principle 4: Environment & Security

No Hardcoded Secrets: Never include real API keys or secrets in code. Use .env and .env.example.

Firebase/Auth Configs: Store Firebase setup files in /src/config/firebase.js or similar — keep it isolated from core logic.

Safe Defaults: Always provide fallback values (e.g., process.env.API_URL || 'http://localhost:3000').



---

 Principle 5: Behavior as AI Assistant

No Hallucination: Do not invent library names, file paths, or tool chains. If unsure, ask the user for clarity.

Explain Before Code: For medium or large tasks, provide a bullet-plan or pseudocode first. Don’t write code until the plan is approved.

Context-Aware Suggestions: Suggestions should match:

Mobile-first UI development (Tailwind + React)

Termux limitations (no Docker, no VS Code extensions)

Git + CLI workflows


Be Explicit About Output: If the output includes multiple files or updates, list them clearly first, then show the content

#  Feature Request

##  The Goal

_Describe the feature you want to build. What is the primary objective? What should the user be able to do once this is complete?_

Example:  
> Build a "Daily Tasks" component where users can check off tasks and earn coins as rewards. Tasks and rewards should persist using Firebase.

---

##  Inspiration & Examples

_List any files in the `examples/` directory that show patterns to follow. Explain why they are relevant.

- **File:** `examples/components/TaskCard.jsx`  
  **Reason:** Uses clean component structure with animation and Tailwind.

- **File:** `examples/utils/rewardSystem.js`  
  **Reason:** Includes logic for calculating and updating user reward points.

##  Required Knowledge

_Provide links to any external API documentation, libraries, or articles that are necessary to understand and build this feature._

## ⚠️ Potential Pitfalls & Gotchas

_What are the common mistakes or tricky parts of this task? Mention anything the AI should be extra careful about._

- Firebase reads/writes should be secured via rules — don’t expose data globally.
- Be mindful of animation performance on low-end mobile devices.
- Tailwind class stacking can get messy — keep classes grouped by purpose.
- Avoid hardcoding reward values — make them configurable if possible.
